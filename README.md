# Alphabet Soup Charity
In this challenge, the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help them select applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. They provide us with their dataset to which we apply our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, we have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:
* EIN and NAME — Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE — Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION — Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION — Government organization classification
* USE_CASE — Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION — Organization type
* STATUS — Active status
* INCOME_AMT — Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS — Special considerations for application
* ASK_AMT — Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL — Was the money used effectively
